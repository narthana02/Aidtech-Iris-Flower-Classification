# Aidtech-Iris-Flower-Classification
TASK 1: 

Iris Flower Classification

Create a machine learning model that can classify the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal length and width.

Dataset: Here

Steps to create the project:

Load the Iris dataset into your Python environment. You can use a library like Scikit-learn to load the dataset.
Pre-process the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets.
Explore the dataset by visualizing the data using scatterplots or histograms.
Select a machine learning algorithm to train your model. You can start with a simple algorithm like K-Nearest Neighbours or Decision Trees.
Train your model using the training set.
Evaluate your model's performance on the testing set.
Use your model to make predictions on new data.
Test your model by inputting new values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to see the predicted species of iris flower.

Let's go through the steps in more detail, summarize the key points, and draw some inferences from the machine learning model built to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

**Step 1: Loading the Iris Dataset**
- The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.
- The dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

**Step 2: Pre-processing the Dataset**
- The dataset is split into two parts: a training set and a testing set.
- The training set (80% of the data) is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set (20% of the data) is used to evaluate the model's performance.
- The `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn is used to achieve this split.

**Step 3: Exploring the Dataset**
- Visualizations are created to explore the dataset.
- Two scatterplots are generated: one showing sepal length vs. sepal width and the other showing petal length vs. petal width.
- Different species are represented by different colors in the scatterplots.
- These visualizations help us understand the distribution of data points and relationships between the features.

**Step 4: Selecting a Machine Learning Algorithm**
- In this example, we chose the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
- KNN is a simple and intuitive algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k-nearest neighbors in the training set.
- The value of `k` is set to 3 in this case.

**Step 5: Training the Model**
- The KNN classifier is created and trained using the training data (X_train and y_train).

**Step 6: Evaluating the Model's Performance**
- The model's performance is evaluated using the testing data.
- The accuracy of the model is calculated, which is the ratio of correctly predicted samples to the total samples in the testing set.
- The classification report is generated, providing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (Iris species).
- This information helps assess how well the model performs for each species.

**Step 7: Making Predictions on New Data**
- The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.
- A single set of measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) is provided as an example of new data.
- The model predicts the species of the Iris flower based on these measurements.

**Summary and Inferences:**
- The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved a certain accuracy on the Iris dataset, indicating its ability to classify the Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.
- The visualization of the data suggests that the different species of Iris flowers exhibit distinct clusters in the feature space.
- KNN is a relatively simple algorithm and may serve as a good starting point for this classification task. However, other algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines can also be explored for potentially better performance.
- The choice of 'k' (number of neighbors) in KNN can impact model performance. Tuning this hyperparameter may lead to improved accuracy.
- The classification report provides a more detailed assessment of the model's performance, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. This information is useful for understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses for different Iris species.

In summary, this project demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, visualizing, training, and evaluating a machine learning model for classifying Iris flower species. The choice of algorithm, hyperparameter tuning, and further exploration can lead to even better results.
